# Project Description  
OptiExchange is a lightweight web application that predicts currency exchange rates for any selected date. It supports major currencies like USD, EUR, GBP, and JPY with a clean, responsive interface featuring dark/light mode. The app calculates predictions client-side using market trend algorithms to estimate historical, current, and future exchange rates. Designed for travelers and forex enthusiasts, it provides quick rate checks through a simple one-page form. Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, this frontend demo simulates realistic rate fluctuations based on volatility patterns.
